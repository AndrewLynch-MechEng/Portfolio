# Portfolio

Hi, I am Andrew Lynch.
I am currently working through an udemy.com "100 Days of Code: Complete Python Pro" class as a way to refresh on the basics I learned and improve
  on the Python coding skills that I learned in the pursuit of my Bachelors of Applied Science in Mechatronics Engineering and Automation.
I am perusing a career change to application development or software engineering.
I will be updating and improving my portfolio often while I continue progressing through the udemy course and improving my skills.

Thank you for stopping by!
